**DZ Handicap Correction (16 → 20)**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Data |
| Priority | P0 |
| Status | Done |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | 2026-04-04 |

### Description
DZ (Team R, R8) was entered with HCP 16 in the initial roster; the correct handicap is 20. Updated in: `templates/pages/season3.page.html`, `public/season3.html`, `CLAUDE.md`, memory store, and KV roster (prod + staging). Fixing this moved DZ into the HCP-20 bracket, making all four singles brackets perfectly even (1v1, 3v3, 3v3, 1v1) and enabling the full singles schedule redesign (PGL-009).

**Singles Schedule Redesign (M25–M40)**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Data |
| Priority | P0 |
| Status | Done |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | 2026-04-04 |

### Description
Full redesign of all 16 singles matches (M25–M40) after DZ's HCP correction (PGL-008). With DZ at HCP 20, all four brackets became even: HCP14 1v1, HCP16 3v3, HCP20 3v3, HCP22 1v1. Produced 12 same-bracket matches and 4 cross-bracket matches (2 favour D, 2 favour R — balanced). No player faces the same opponent in both Round 1 (October) and Round 2 (November). All matches paired into foursomes (M25+M26=A, M27+M28=B, etc.). Updated in prod and staging KV.

**Final pairings:**

| Match | Team D | Team R | HCP | Round |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|-------|
| M25 | Anuj Pandey | Shailendra Singh | 14 | Oct |
| M26 | Bala Sankaran | Srikant N | 22 | Oct |

**Auth Security Audit — Credentials Compliance**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Chore |
| Priority | P1 |
| Status | Done |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | 2026-04-04 |

### Description
Audit of credential storage to confirm no usernames or passwords are hardcoded in source code, config files, or version-controlled secrets.

**Findings — compliant:**
- Credentials stored in a **Cloudflare Worker Secret** (`AUTH_USERS`), not in source code or `wrangler.jsonc`.
- Format: JSON array of `{ username, passwordHash, role, team, display }` — passwords are SHA-256 hashed before storage.
- At runtime, `src/index.ts` line 128 reads `JSON.parse(env.AUTH_USERS ?? '[]')`. Incoming passwords are hashed before comparison.
- `.dev.vars` contains only `WRITE_KEY=rtgs-kv-w-2026` (non-credential shared secret, not user auth).
- No plaintext passwords found anywhere in the repository.

**Gap noted (not a blocker):** Adding a new user requires Wrangler CLI access. Admin self-service user management is a separate story if needed in future.

### Commits

**Application Architecture SVG Diagram**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Chore |
| Priority | P2 |
| Status | Planned |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | 2026-04-04 |

### Description
Create a detailed SVG architecture diagram for the RTGS PGL application, targeting new developers onboarding to the codebase. The diagram should give a developer a full mental model of the system before touching any code.

**Output:**
- File: `docs/architecture.svg`
- Linked from `README.md` with a short description

**What to show:**

_Services & components:_
- Browser client (HTML/CSS/JS served as static assets)
- Cloudflare Worker (`src/index.ts`) — the single backend entry point
- Cloudflare KV — namespaces: schedule, rosters, results, analytics, gallery metadata, error logs, help inbox
- Cloudflare R2 — gallery image binary storage
- GitHub repository — source of truth, manual deploy trigger

_API endpoints (grouped by domain):_
- Auth: `POST /api/login`
- Schedule: `GET /api/schedule`, `POST /api/schedule`
- Results: `GET /api/results`, `POST /api/results`
- Gallery: `POST /api/gallery/upload`, `GET /api/gallery`, `POST /api/gallery/like`, `POST /api/gallery/comment`, `DELETE /api/gallery/:id`
- Analytics: `GET /api/analytics`, `POST /api/track`
- Ops: `GET /api/log`, `POST /api/log`, `GET /api/help`, `POST /api/help`

_Data flows (labelled arrows):_
- Browser → Worker: HTTP requests with Bearer token or X-Write-Key header
- Worker → KV: reads/writes per endpoint (show which KV key each endpoint touches)
- Worker → R2: image upload (binary) and image serve (stream)
- Worker → Browser: JSON responses and static asset serving
- Developer → GitHub: git push → manual `wrangler deploy` → Worker updated

_Auth layer:_
- Show the two auth paths: Bearer token (HMAC-SHA256, 30-min expiry) and X-Write-Key (server-to-server)
- Show role access boundaries: which roles can reach which endpoint groups

**Style guidance:** Clean dark-background diagram to match the site's navy/gold theme (`#0a1628` background, `#c9a84c` accent lines, white labels). Group related endpoints into swim lanes or bounded boxes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- A new developer can read the diagram and answer: "where does data live?", "how does auth work?", "what does the Worker do?", and "how does a deploy happen?" — without reading any code first.
- All API endpoints documented in `src/index.ts` are represented.
- README updated with a link and one-line description of the diagram.

**Score Update Audit Log**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Feature |
| Priority | P1 |
| Status | Planned |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | — |

### Description
Every change to a match result must be recorded in an immutable audit trail. The audit log is displayed inline at the bottom of the match detail modal, visible to Admin and Captains.

**What each audit entry captures:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `matchId` | Match number (e.g. "Match 3") |
| `action` | `submitted` / `approved` / `disputed` / `admin_override` |
| `prevResult` | Result before the change (null if first submission) |
| `newResult` | Result after the change |
| `username` | Who performed the action |
| `role` | Their role at the time (`admin` / `captain`) |
| `ts` | ISO timestamp |

**Storage:** Append-only array per match, stored in KV under a dedicated key (e.g. `season3_audit_match_3`). Never overwrite — only append.

**Where it appears:** Bottom of the existing match detail modal as a collapsible "Match History" section. Collapsed by default to keep the modal clean; expands on click.

**Who can see it:**
- Admin — always visible
- Captain — visible on any match (not restricted to their own team's matches)
- Fan / Organiser — hidden

**Backend changes (`src/index.ts`):**
- On every `POST /api/results` action, append an audit entry to the match's audit key in KV
- New `GET /api/audit?match=<id>` endpoint — returns the full audit array for a match; requires Bearer token with role `admin` or `captain`

**Frontend changes (`templates/pages/season3.page.html`):**
- Add "Match History" collapsible section to the match detail modal
- Fetch audit entries from `GET /api/audit?match=<id>` when the modal opens (only if role is admin or captain)
- Render as a timeline list (icon + action label + username/role + timestamp)

### Acceptance Criteria
- Every result submission, approval, dispute, and admin override creates an audit entry
- Entries are append-only — no entry can be deleted or modified
- Match History section visible in the modal for Admin and Captain; hidden for Fan/Organiser
- Section is collapsed by default, expands on click
- Timestamps shown in local time, formatted as `DD MMM HH:mm`
- Works on mobile at 375px

**Course Names Popup — "10+ Courses" click on hero strip**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Feature |
| Priority | P2 |
| Status | Planned |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | — |

### Description
When a user clicks the "10+ Courses" text in the season3 hero strip (`Ryder Cup Format · 16 Players · 2 Teams · 10+ Courses`), a modal popup opens showing the full list of courses for the season.

**Courses (Season 3):**
1. Ashbrook
2. Galloping Hill
3. Neshanic Valley
4. Spook Brook
5. Quailbrook
6. Royce Brook
7. Fox Hollow
8. Tamarack East
9. Tamarack West
10. Berkshire Valley

**Trigger:** The "10+ Courses" portion of the hero-sub line becomes a clickable element (cursor pointer, subtle gold underline on hover). The rest of the line ("Ryder Cup Format · 16 Players · 2 Teams ·") remains plain text.

**Modal design** (matches site design system):
- Dark navy background `#0a1628`, gold-tinted border `rgba(201,168,76,0.18)`
- Title: "Season 3 Courses" in Playfair Display
- Simple numbered list of course names in Raleway
- Close button (✕) top right
- No border-radius (sharp edges)
- Mobile friendly — full width on 375px

**Implementation:**
- Only `templates/pages/season3.page.html` changes needed
- Reuse existing modal overlay pattern already in the file
- Course list hardcoded in JS (no KV needed)

### Acceptance Criteria
- Clicking "10+ Courses" opens the modal; clicking outside or ✕ closes it
- All 10 course names displayed as a numbered list
- Modal matches the dark navy/gold design system
- Works on mobile at 375px
- "Ryder Cup Format", "16 Players", "2 Teams" portions are NOT clickable

**Gallery Audit Log — Upload & Delete Tracking**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Feature |
| Priority | P1 |
| Status | Planned |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | — |

### Description
Extend gallery audit coverage so every upload and delete is permanently recorded. Likes and comments are not audited.

**What is already captured (uploads):**
- `uploadedBy` — username
- `uploadedAt` — ISO timestamp

**What needs adding (deletes — currently zero trace):**
Every `DELETE /api/gallery/:id` must append an audit entry to a dedicated KV key before removing the image from R2 and gallery metadata.

**Audit entry schema (per event):**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `action` | `uploaded` or `deleted` |
| `imageId` | Unique image ID |
| `caption` | Image caption/description at time of event |
| `username` | Who performed the action |
| `role` | Their role (`admin` / `organiser`) |
| `ts` | ISO timestamp |

**Storage:** Append-only array in KV under key `season3_gallery_audit`. Never overwrite — only append.

**Where it appears:** A small clock/history icon (🕐 or similar) on each photo card in the gallery, visible to Admin only. Clicking it opens a compact inline drawer or tooltip showing that image's audit trail (uploaded by X on date, deleted by Y on date if applicable).

**Backend changes (`src/index.ts`):**
- On `POST /api/gallery/upload` — append `uploaded` entry to `season3_gallery_audit`
- On `DELETE /api/gallery/:id` — append `deleted` entry before removing the image
- New `GET /api/gallery/audit?imageId=<id>` endpoint — returns audit entries for a specific image; requires Bearer token with `role === 'admin'`

**Frontend changes (`public/gallery.html` or template):**
- History icon rendered on each photo card only when `SESSION.role === 'admin'`
- On click: fetch `GET /api/gallery/audit?imageId=<id>` and render inline as a compact timeline

### Acceptance Criteria
- Every upload creates an audit entry (backfill not required for existing images)
- Every delete creates an audit entry before the image is removed
- Audit entries are append-only and cannot be deleted
- History icon visible on each photo for Admin only — hidden for all other roles
- Clicking the icon shows that image's audit trail (uploaded by, deleted by if applicable)
- Works on mobile at 375px

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Feature |
| Priority | P2 |
| Status | Done |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | 2026-04-05 |

### Description
Extended `/analytics.html` read access to Captains and Organisers. Same page, same full dataset, no filtering by role.

Also fixed staging banner obscuring the fixed nav on mobile.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Captain can navigate to `/analytics.html` and see full analytics data
- [x] Organiser can navigate to `/analytics.html` and see full analytics data
- [x] Fan / unauthenticated users are still redirected away
- [x] Backend `GET /api/analytics` returns data for captain and organiser Bearer tokens
- [x] Analytics link visible in top nav for admin/captain/organiser; hidden for fans
- [x] Mobile: nav links collapse into ⋮ overflow menu; Analytics item is role-gated
- [x] Staging banner no longer obscures nav on mobile

**Capture City & ISP in Analytics Events**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Feature |
| Priority | P2 |
| Status | Done |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | 2026-04-05 |

### Description
Enrich each analytics event with the visitor's city and ISP name. All data is available from Cloudflare request metadata — no external API calls needed.

**Data sources (server-side, `src/index.ts` POST `/api/track`):**
| Field | Cloudflare source |
|-------|-------------------|
| `city` | `request.cf.city` |
| `isp` | `request.cf.asOrganization` |

Full IP address is intentionally NOT stored — city + ISP is sufficient for analytics and less sensitive for this private invite-only league.

**Scope:** Analytics events only (`POST /api/track`). Score audit logs (PGL-024) and gallery audit logs (PGL-026) are not affected.

**Backend changes (`src/index.ts`):**
- In the `POST /api/track` handler, read `request.cf?.city` and `request.cf?.asOrganization` server-side and append them to the stored event entry
- These fields are already available on the `request.cf` object in Cloudflare Workers — no client-side changes needed
- Handle gracefully if either field is undefined (store as `null`)

**Frontend changes:** Add City and ISP columns to the event log table in `analytics.html`. For existing events that predate this feature, display `—` in those columns.

**Analytics dashboard (`public/analytics.html`):**
- Add `City` and `ISP` columns to the event log table
- Render `event.city ?? '—'` and `event.isp ?? '—'` for each row
- Old events without these fields show `—` automatically

### Acceptance Criteria
- New analytics events include `city` and `isp` fields
- Both fields are `null` if Cloudflare does not provide them (no errors thrown)
- Existing events without these fields are unaffected (backwards compatible)
- Full IP address is never stored
- Analytics table shows City and ISP columns; old entries display `—`

**Custom Domain for Staging — staging.rtgspgl.org**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Chore |
| Priority | P2 |
| Status | Planned |
| Created | 2026-04-04 |
| Completed | — |

### Description
`rtgspgl.org` is already registered and pointed to prod in Cloudflare. Add `staging.rtgspgl.org` as the custom domain for the staging Worker environment, replacing the default `rtgs-pgl-staging.selvaraj-s.workers.dev` URL.

**Current state:**
| Environment | URL |
|-------------|-----|
| Production | `rtgspgl.org` (custom domain, already configured) |
| Staging | `rtgs-pgl-staging.selvaraj-s.workers.dev` (workers.dev default) |

**Target state:**
| Environment | URL |
|-------------|-----|
| Production | `rtgspgl.org` |
| Staging | `staging.rtgspgl.org` |

**Steps:**

1. **Cloudflare DNS** — Add a CNAME record in the `rtgspgl.org` zone:
   - Name: `staging`
   - Target: `rtgs-pgl-staging.selvaraj-s.workers.dev`
   - Proxied: Yes (orange cloud)

2. **`wrangler.jsonc`** — Add a `routes` entry to the staging environment block:
   ```jsonc
   "routes": [{ "pattern": "staging.rtgspgl.org/*", "zone_name": "rtgspgl.org" }]
   ```

3. **`CLAUDE.md`** — Update the staging URL reference from `rtgs-pgl-staging.selvaraj-s.workers.dev` to `staging.rtgspgl.org`

4. **E2E test config** — Update any hardcoded staging URLs in test files or scripts

**Note:** The Cloudflare DNS step must be done manually in the Cloudflare dashboard (cannot be done via Wrangler CLI alone). The `wrangler.jsonc` change can be committed and deployed normally.

### Acceptance Criteria
- `https://staging.rtgspgl.org` serves the staging Worker
- `https://rtgspgl.org` continues to serve prod unchanged
- `npx wrangler deploy --env staging` deploys to `staging.rtgspgl.org`
- CLAUDE.md and any test configs updated with the new staging URL
